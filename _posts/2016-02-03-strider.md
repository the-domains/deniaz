# Strider

> All that is gold does not glitter,  
> Not all those who wander are lost;
> 
> The old that is strong does not wither,
> 
> Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
> 
> From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
> 
> A light from the shadow shall spring;
> 
> Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
> 
> The crownless again shall be king.
