# Strider

> All that is gold does not glitter,  
> Not all those who wander are lost;  
> The old that is strong does not wither,  
> Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
> 
> From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
> A light from the shadow shall spring;  
> Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
> The crownless again shall be king.
